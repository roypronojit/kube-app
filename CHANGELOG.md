## 2026.09.13.0

### Added

- Pydantic application model and YAML parsing/validation for the
  `kubeapp.dev/v1alpha1` `Application` resource.
- Helm-values generator that maps application name, image, service port,
  resources, and scaling bounds to a plain Python dictionary.
- Direct Kubernetes-manifest generator for a Deployment and optional ClusterIP
  Service.
- Generated example manifest at `output/basic-manifest.yaml` for
  `examples/basic.yaml`.
- Unit tests for Helm-values and Kubernetes-manifest generation.
- README usage instructions for validation, values generation, manifest tests,
  and optional cluster dry-run validation.
- Renamed stale Helm helper references from `kube-app-scaffold.*` to
  `kube-app.*`.
- Made the Helm chart notes template safe when `httpRoute` is not configured.

### Pending

- Helm CLI integration (`helm template` and release installation).
- HorizontalPodAutoscaler and VerticalPodAutoscaler support.
- Additional service types, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and ServiceAccounts in the
  application schema and direct manifest generator.
